Stories of Jammu genocide victims that were passed down to generations.

1. Aamir Khatana 

        "My name is Amir and i belong to one of the survival family of JAMMU GENOCIDE 1947. Many of elder 
        members of our family were martyred by the locals with the  help of state and RSS goons. My grandfather
        and his friend were the two survivalist of our village. Consisting of 57 muslim families. About 30 percent
        of the population of our village was migrated to Pakistan and rest of 70 percent was martyerd by the RSS 
        goons and communalists groups which were backed by the govt and administration of that time. All the houses
        of our village were burnt and destroyed. As the peoples of our village were innocent and have no idea about 
        that things. They were unarmed and easily were hunted by Goons in the shape of JATHAAS. Jathas which had some
        locals and some outsiders & those jathas were Fully trained in the neighborhood villages of our village. My
        maternal-mother's mother was also the survival of that horrific genocide. Her two daughters had done the
        suicide by taking poison bcz of the abduction and rape. My maternal grandfather's two brothers were burnt
        alive in their own houses. While everyone talk about the massacres, genocides, roits but no one has spoken
        up a word on that massacre. The victims and martyers of Jammu carnages still wait, some in body and the rest
        in soul for justice which has alluded them all these decades. Unfortunately, however, the most gruesome of
        massacres of 1947 involving killing of tens of thousands of Muslims with official connivance in Jammu Province 
        has remained the least talked about occurrence in the sub-continental narratives."
